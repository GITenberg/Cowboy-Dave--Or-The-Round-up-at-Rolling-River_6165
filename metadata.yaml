description: What was coming seemed to be a thunderous cloud of dust, from the midst
  of which came strange, shrill sounds, punc-tuated with sharp cries, that did not
  appear to be altogether human. The dust-cloud grew thicker, the thunder sounded
  louder, and the yells were shriller. From one of a group of dull, red buildings
  a sun-bronzed man stepped forth. He shaded his eyes with a brown, powerful hand,
  gazed for an instant toward the approaching cloud of animated and vociferous dust.
